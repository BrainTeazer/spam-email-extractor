 Dear ML students,

with a small delay, I just published the first homework assignment for this
course on Moodle. In the future, it will be available online on Tuesdays.

Please have a look at the (updated!) details on the homework assignments on
the Moodle page. The submission process and deadline is described there,
too.

You are invited to post questions on the procedure via the questions forum.

Moreover, please take note of the Tutorial time slot that has been selected
(Wednesdays, 19:15). Those, who cannot join that slot still will have
access to the reference solutions and can join the bookable slots with me.

Best regards,
